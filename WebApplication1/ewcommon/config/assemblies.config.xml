<!-- 
	
	This file is not used, but is a guide as to how to best use assemblies
	to load in Eonicweb and its associated assemblies in a local site.
	
	The idea is to use the GAC (and its mappings where possible) and make adjustments 
	if needing to debug a specific local site.
	
	BIN FOLDER:
	===========
	
	The only thing REQUIRED in a BIN folder is EonicWebv4_0.dll, whether it be copied there or placed
	there by a debug project.
	
	The reason for this is that the SectionHandler across the machine does not specify a version number (or a fully qualified name)
	which means that it can't load the SectionHandler from the GAC.
	
	<section name="messagingProviders" type="Eonic.ProviderSectionHandler, EonicWebV4_0" restartOnExternalChanges="false"/>

	If we add a version number to this, then yes, we would not need local BIN, but then versions not mapped in the GAC would fall over.

	<!-- 
		If you are building the site against a new version of an assembly, then you need to update the mapping 
		locally to point to the version that you are building, because any dependent assemblies in the GAC
		will be looking for a different version of that assembly. 
		
		e.g. 
			EonicWebV4_0 4.1.1.89 and CampaignMonitor 1.0.1.0 are in the GAC
			You are developing EonicWebV4_0 4.1.1.91, but not CampaignMonitor.
			CampaignMonitor will be looking for EonicWeb 4.1.1.89, which will cause a conflict in 
			any references to EonicWeb, so you need to update the mappings for EonicWeb, as below.
